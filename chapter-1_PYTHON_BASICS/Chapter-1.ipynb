    "An expression in Python is made up of one or more of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Literals: Constant values such as numbers, strings, or other fixed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: 42, 'hello', 3.14, True\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables: Names that represent values stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: x, y, name\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operators: Symbols that perform operations on one or more operands (values or variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), == (equality comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function Calls: Invocations of functions that return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: len('hello'), sum([1, 2, 3]), max(5, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Parentheses: Used to group expressions and control the order of evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: (2 + 3) * 4, max(1, (2 + 3))\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 5\n",
    "This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "In Python, expressions and statements serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for writing effective code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expression\n",
    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a single value. Expressions return a value when evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Expressions:\n",
    "1. `2 + 3` evaluates to 5\n",
    "2. `len(\"hello\")` evaluates to 5\n",
    "3. `x * 2` (if x is 4, it evaluates to 8)\n",
    "4. `'spam' + 'spamspam'` evaluates to 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "5. `3 * (4 + 5)` evaluates to 27\n",
    "In each case, the expression produces a value as a result of the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement\n",
    "A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. Statements perform an action but do not necessarily return a value. They may contain expressions within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Statements:\n",
    "1. Assignment Statement: `x = 5`\n",
    "2. Print Statement: `print(\"Hello, world!\")`\n",
    "3. If Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "   if x > 0:\n",
    "       \n",
    "       print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An expression evaluates to a value.\n",
    "- A statement performs an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expressions always return a value.\n",
    "- Statements do not return a value; they simply execute an action.\n"

    "## Question 8\n",
    "Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "In Python, variable names must adhere to specific rules, which determine whether a name is valid or invalid. The name eggs is a valid variable name, whereas 100 is not, due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting Character:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - They cannot start with a digit (0-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `eggs` starts with a letter 'e', so it is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `100` starts with a digit '1', so it is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subsequent Characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After the first character, variable names can include letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - While eggs includes only letters and is valid throughout, 100 fails at the initial digit requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reserved Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variable names cannot be any of the Python reserved words (such as `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, etc.), though this rule does not specifically apply to the given example."
